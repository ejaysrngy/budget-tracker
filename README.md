# Budget Tracker App
<br />
A code along project from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Course. <br />
This project focuses on ReactJS and I changed some parts on my own so that I can have a piece of my own logic in the project, namely: <br /> 
- replacing the hard-coded dropdown year filter <br /> 
- the "Show All" choice in the dropdown year filter <br /> 
- and styling
